# ML-Projects
## Collection of Machine Learning Projects.
### 1. Water Portability -
      The objective of the project is to determine the purity of water from the TDS ( Total Dissolved Solid ) value of the water sample. The model needs to be fed with data that will contain the amount of different chemicals dissolved in the sample and will predict if the water is pure or not.
### 2. Zomato Data Analysis -
      This project is on Exploratory Data Analysis. For this project I have a dataset on Zomato that has records of sales in different countries, types of services, address of different restaurants that use their service etc. This project will help us to understand Data Visualization and Data Analysis. Different Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib etc are used in this project.
### 3. Breast Cancer Detection -
      This project is on developing a model to predict Breast Cancer. It will determine between Malignant and Benign. 2 different models are used here - Logical Regression and Random Forest.
